This repository is meant to share the code for the AceAlert Discord bot used in the ✮Card Game✮ Discord server.
Do not reach out to me for anything related to this bot except if you are a member of the Discord server.

Latest change log:
Added some commands related to the YouTube channel and some light moderation, and improved some notes.
I honestly forgot that i even wrote this bot so i'm not going to touch anything from the youtube logic and absolutely not look at it.

That restart command is broken as hell lol.
