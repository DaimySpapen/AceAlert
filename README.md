# AceAlert Discord Bot

This repository is meant to share the code for the **AceAlert Discord bot** used in the **✮Card Game✮ Discord server**.

Latest change log:
Added some commands related to the YouTube channel and some light moderation, and improved some notes.
I honestly forgot that i even wrote this bot so i'm not going to touch anything from the youtube logic and absolutely not look at it.

That restart command is broken as hell lol.

- **Added** an image describe function by reacting with "❓" to a message with 1 or more image(s).
- **Added** an `!ask` command that allows you to ask a question to an LLM. This command also supports images.
- **Added** fancy markdown to the README :)
- **Removed** the `!restart` command.  
  _Why did I even have that in the first place? And it was broken anyways._
